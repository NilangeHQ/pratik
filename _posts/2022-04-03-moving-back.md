So as per the latest update, WP is changing its <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/plan-features/#word-press-com-pro" target="_blank">pricing model</a>, and TBH it doesn’t make sense. Paying >1k INR/mo is simply a weird proposition. Of course, you would get access to their Premium themes and all, but it is a pretty bad deal (unless you have a business set up on wp.com).

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/STrPtKSTKAALim3TZQ" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p></p>

And their new block code editor isn’t great either (it’s pretty bad than I expected, the old editor was a hundred times better), and honestly, I miss messing up with my sites (right now my domain is literally locked by WP). So I’m setting up a parallel web universe on GH pages (using Jekyll) for my weblogs-
<ul class="list">
<li><a href = "https://pratik.nilange.com">pratik.nilange.com</a> -> pratiknilange.in</li>
<li><a href="https://nilange.com/gallery">nilange.com/gallery</a> -> gallery.pratiknilange.in</li>
</ul>
Once my contract with WP ends later this year, I will be migrating all my data to the above-mentioned sites. My private log (#AKL) would still be available on WordPress as it is under the free tier.
