title: About
---

I’m an engineer and a self-taught graphic designer living in Bangalore. I also write about electronics (mostly processors), motorcycles, cars, cybersecurity, and cricket. I co-created The Boring Magazine, Gradiento, Internet Of Bings, The Circuit Breakers, 657th Studio, Nil 5tudio (sadly all of them are defunct A/O ’21). I speak in English, Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Spanish, and code in JS, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python.

### Education
I attended the <a href="https://reva.edu.in" target="_blank">REVA University</a>, and graduated with a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2021. 

### Work
I'm currently working as a Trainee Engineer in the Wealth Management Product team (<a href = "https://tcs.com/bancs" target = "_blank">BaNCS</a>) at <a href="https://twitter.com/tcs" target="_blank">Tata Consultancy Services</a>. I was previously heading the technical department at <a href="https://instagram.com/eventsatforce" target="_blank">FORCE, REVA University</a>.
